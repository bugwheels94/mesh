Mesh provides many useful commands to simplify a developer's day to day life while working on node/npm.

1. Have you ever got tired of adding commitizen OR semantic-release OR prettier to many repos while boilerplating?
2. Did you ever wanted to have linked one package to another and get realtime changes in each repo?
3. Is it hard to run same command on many repos at once?
